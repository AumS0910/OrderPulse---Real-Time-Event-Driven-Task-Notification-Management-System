# OrderPulse Project Documentation

## Project Overview
OrderPulse is an advanced order management system implementing event-driven architecture with real-time features.

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Spring Boot 3.5.4
- Frontend: React (upcoming)
- Infrastructure:
  - Apache Kafka & Zookeeper: Event streaming
  - Redis: Caching
  - PostgreSQL: Primary database
  - Elasticsearch: Search capabilities

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Project Setup (Completed)
- Created Spring Boot project with required dependencies
- Configured basic application properties
- Set up project structure with organized packages

### 2. Backend Implementation

#### 2.1 Core Configuration (Completed)
- Implemented main application class with JPA auditing
- Configured Kafka topics with proper partitioning
- Added detailed documentation and comments

#### 2.2 Entity Layer (In Progress)
- Created `OrderStatus` enum for state management
- Implemented `Order` entity with:
  - JPA annotations for database mapping
  - Validation constraints for data integrity
  - Audit fields with automatic timestamp management
  - Optimistic locking for concurrent modifications
  - Detailed documentation for Kafka integration

### 3. System Design Concepts

#### 3.1 Event-Driven Architecture with Kafka
- **Topic Partitioning**: Configured multiple partitions for parallel processing
- **Message Reliability**: Set up replication factor for fault tolerance
- **Event Flow**: 
  - Orders saved to database
  - Order events published to Kafka
  - Consumers process events asynchronously

#### 3.2 Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Entities represent business objects with clear boundaries
- Value objects (OrderStatus) for immutable concepts
- Rich domain model with business logic

#### 3.3 Data Integrity
- Bean validation for input validation
- JPA auditing for timestamp management
- Optimistic locking for concurrent modifications

## Next Steps
1. Implement Order Repository
2. Create Kafka Producer/Consumer
3. Develop Service Layer
4. Add REST Controllers
