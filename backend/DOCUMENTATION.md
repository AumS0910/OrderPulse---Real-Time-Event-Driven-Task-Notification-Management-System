# OrderPulse Project Documentation

## Project Overview
OrderPulse is an advanced order management system implementing event-driven architecture with real-time features.

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Spring Boot 3.5.4
- Frontend: React (upcoming)
- Infrastructure:
  - Apache Kafka & Zookeeper: Event streaming
  - Redis: Caching
  - PostgreSQL: Primary database
  - Elasticsearch: Search capabilities

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Project Setup
- Created Spring Boot project with required dependencies
- Configured basic application properties
- Set up project structure with organized packages

### 2. Backend Implementation
#### 2.1 Entity Layer
- Created `Order` entity with:
  - Basic order fields (id, customerName, totalAmount, etc.)
  - Audit fields (createdAt, updatedAt)
  - Status tracking using `OrderStatus` enum
  - JPA annotations for database mapping

#### 2.2 Repository Layer
- Implemented `OrderRepository` interface extending `JpaRepository`
- Added custom query methods for business requirements

#### 2.3 Service Layer
- Created `OrderService` interface defining business operations
- Implemented `OrderServiceImpl` with:
  - Transaction management
  - Business logic for CRUD operations
  - Integration with Kafka for event publishing
  - Exception handling for not found scenarios

### 3. Infrastructure Setup
- Configured `docker-compose.yml` with required services
- Set up Kafka topic configuration
- Implemented basic Kafka producer for order events

### 4. System Design Concepts

#### 4.1 Repository Pattern
- Abstracts data access logic
- Makes switching databases easier
- Centralizes data access logic
- Provides clean separation between data access and business logic

#### 4.2 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Keep interfaces focused and specific
- Only include methods that are needed
- Prevents clients from depending on methods they don't use
- Promotes maintainability and reduces coupling

#### 4.3 Event-Driven Architecture
- Using Kafka for event streaming
- Decouples order processing from order creation
- Enables async processing and better scalability

#### 4.4 Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Concepts
- Organized code around business domain
- Used entities to represent business objects
- Implemented value objects (OrderStatus)

#### 4.5 Service Layer Pattern
- Encapsulates business logic
- Manages transactions
- Provides clear API for business operations
- Handles cross-cutting concerns

#### 4.6 Transaction Management
- ACID properties for data consistency
- Read-only optimization for queries
- Transaction boundaries at service layer

#### 2.4 Controller Layer
- Created RESTful endpoints in `OrderController`
- Implemented CRUD operations with proper HTTP methods
- Added input validation using `@Valid`
- Proper response status codes and error handling

#### 2.5 Exception Handling
- Implemented global exception handling
- Created structured error responses
- Proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios

#### 4.6 Transaction Management
- ACID properties for data consistency
- Read-only optimization for queries
- Transaction boundaries at service layer

#### 4.7 RESTful API Design
- Resource-based routing (/api/orders)
- Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Meaningful status codes (200, 201, 204, 404, 500)
- Structured error responses

#### 4.8 Global Exception Handling
- Centralized error handling
- Consistent error response format
- Proper error status codes
- Separation of concerns

## Next Steps
1. Add WebSocket configuration for real-time updates
2. Implement Redis caching
3. Set up frontend React application
