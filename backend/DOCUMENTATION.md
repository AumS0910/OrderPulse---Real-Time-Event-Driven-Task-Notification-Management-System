# OrderPulse Project Documentation

## Project Overview
OrderPulse is an advanced order management system implementing event-driven architecture with real-time features.

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Spring Boot 3.5.4
- Frontend: React (upcoming)
- Infrastructure:
  - Apache Kafka & Zookeeper: Event streaming
  - Redis: Caching
  - PostgreSQL: Primary database
  - Elasticsearch: Search capabilities

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Project Setup (Completed)
- Created Spring Boot project with required dependencies
- Configured basic application properties
- Set up project structure with organized packages

### 2. Backend Implementation

#### 2.1 Core Configuration (Completed)
- Implemented main application class with JPA auditing
- Configured Kafka topics with proper partitioning
- Added detailed documentation and comments

#### 2.2 Entity Layer (Completed)
- Created `OrderStatus` enum for state management
- Implemented `Order` entity with:
  - JPA annotations for database mapping
  - Validation constraints for data integrity
  - Audit fields with automatic timestamp management
  - Optimistic locking for concurrent modifications
  - Detailed documentation for Kafka integration

#### 2.3 Repository Layer (Completed)
- Implemented `OrderRepository` with:
  - Basic CRUD operations through JpaRepository
  - Custom query methods for business requirements
  - Case-insensitive search capabilities
  - Date range filtering
  - Custom JPQL queries for complex operations

#### 2.4 Kafka Integration (Completed)
- Created `OrderProducer` for publishing events:
  - JSON serialization of orders
  - Reliable message delivery
  - Error handling and logging
  - Event metadata inclusion
- Implemented `OrderEvent` for message structure:
  - Event type tracking
  - Timestamp information
  - Full order data inclusion

#### 2.5 Service Layer (Completed)
- Implemented `OrderService` interface defining core business operations
- Created `OrderServiceImpl` with comprehensive features:
  - Transaction management for data consistency
  - Integration with Kafka for event publishing
  - Proper exception handling with custom exceptions
  - Business logic for order processing
  - Status management and validation

#### 2.6 Testing Layer (Completed)
- Implemented comprehensive unit tests for OrderService:
  - Test coverage for all CRUD operations
  - Verification of Kafka event publishing
  - Error handling scenarios
  - Mock-based testing of dependencies
  - Edge cases and validation testing

#### 2.7 REST API Layer (Completed)
- Implemented DTOs for request/response handling:
  - `OrderRequest` for order creation with validation
  - `OrderResponse` for client consumption
  - `OrderStatusUpdateRequest` for status updates
- Created `OrderController` with RESTful endpoints:
  - POST /api/orders - Create new order
  - GET /api/orders/{id} - Retrieve order by ID
  - GET /api/orders - List all orders with filtering
  - PUT /api/orders/{id}/status - Update order status
  - DELETE /api/orders/{id} - Delete order
  - GET /api/orders/customer/{customerName} - Find orders by customer
  - GET /api/orders/status/{status} - Find orders by status

#### 2.8 Exception Handling (Completed)
- Implemented global exception handling:
  - Centralized error handling with `@RestControllerAdvice`
  - Standardized error responses with `ErrorResponse` DTO
  - Specific handlers for common exceptions:
    - OrderNotFoundException (404 Not Found)
    - Validation errors (400 Bad Request)
    - Constraint violations
    - Generic error handling
  - Consistent error format across API
  - Detailed error messages with timestamps

#### 2.9 API Documentation (Completed)
- Implemented OpenAPI/Swagger documentation:
  - Added springdoc-openapi dependency
  - Configured OpenAPI information and servers
  - Documented all REST endpoints with:
    - Operation descriptions
    - Request/response schemas
    - HTTP status codes
    - Example payloads
  - Access URLs:
    - Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
    - OpenAPI JSON: http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs
    - OpenAPI YAML: http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs.yaml

## Next Steps
1. Implement Kafka Consumer
2. Add Integration Tests
3. Set up API Documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
4. Implement Rate Limiting and Security
2. Add Frontend Implementation
3. Set up CI/CD Pipeline
4. Deploy to Production Environment
